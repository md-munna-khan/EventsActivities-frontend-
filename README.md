## 📌 Project Overview

Events & Activities is a role-based event management platform where users can **discover**, **join**, **create**, and **manage** real-life activities such as trips, concerts, workshops, meetups, sports events, and hobby gatherings.

The platform includes three user roles:

* **Client** – Browse and join events.
* **Host** – Create and manage events.
* **Admin** – Approve hosts, moderate the platform, and manage events & users.

This repository contains the **Frontend (Next.js App Router)** that communicates with the Backend API.

## 🧪 Testing Flow

1. Register/Login
2. Apply as host → Admin approval
3. Create event (Host)
4. Approve event (Admin)
5. Join event (Client)
6. After completion → Add Review

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

* For Next/Image using `fill`, always add a `sizes` prop.
* Rename the asset `public/evenzo .png` to `evenzo.png` to prevent build errors.
* For server actions redirect issues, return `{ redirectTo: '/path' }` instead of using `redirect()` directly.
